# Hello, my name is Isaac Doll and this codes solves the formula for the surface area of a rectangular prism.

print ("This code will give you the area of a rectangle. To follow the formula you'll need to input a length, width and height")

#For example, if your length is 4 inches, width 9 inches, and height 41 inches. the answer would be 1138in squared

import math

print("type in three numbers")

length = input("what's the length") 
width = input("what's the width")
height = input("what's the height")

L = length 
W = width 
H = height 

# Now that you have your inputs just hit the return key and let the code solve the equation. The code runs through the formula using PEMDAS and solves it.

result = 2*(W*L + H*L + H*W)

print(result)

# if its right then congrats you've got the formula for a rectangular prism.
